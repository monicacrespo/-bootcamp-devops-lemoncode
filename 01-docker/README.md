# Docker Exercises

### Application structure 

The application consists of three components:

* A front-end in Node.js Express web application 
* A backend API in .NET Core that uses a MongoDB database to store the data
* A MongoDB database


### Solution structure 

```
├── 1.lemoncode-challenge
├── 2.exercise-01
├── 3.exercise-02
├── README.md
├── topics.json
```

The `1.lemoncode-challenge` folder contains the application's code AS IS, without any changes, provided by Lemoncode. 

The `2.exercise-01` folder contains the steps to dockerize the app.

The `3.exercise-02` folder contains the steps to use Docker Compose improving Developer Experience.

The `topics.json` file contains few records that you can import into MongoDB database using any MongoDB GUI Client tool of your preference. For these exercises I will use MongoDB Compass.
